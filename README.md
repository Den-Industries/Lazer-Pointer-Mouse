# Lazer-Pointer-Mouse
It uses projector and camera. Projector projects screen to the wall and camera look at this. Camera has small expose that allows it to see only really bright things like lazer pointer. And then there is a programm that finds lazer on the screen and convert it to the screen coordinates with mouse logic. All made in pycharm with python.
# Using
You need to setup a projector and camera both connected to your computer. Camera must see all projected screen. Then you need to launch program and choose a projected screen rectangle on the image from camera. Points must be choosen clockwise and start with top left. Then you need to use your laser pointer and point it to the projected screen. Program presses left mouse button when laser stays in one place.

Program using mouse emulation, so be carefull!

If you need - you can change HSV filters or camera exposition for better work. You also can change a mouse logic for your purposes.
Have fun!
